Content Manager (Creator)
==========================

Content managers possess the capability to both create new nodes and make edits to existing ones, including adjusting connections between nodes. To identify whether you have content manager privileges, simply look for a badge labeled "Content manager" in your homepage.

Editing textual info and renaming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a content manager, you have the ability to edit all textual information within any node, with the exception of the schema. Simply click on the pen icon and you can easily modify the text within any node.

.. note::

    **Think before renaming things that have connections!** 
	For instance, imagine you rename the language node "French" to "Italian". In this case, all users who were previously "French" speakers will now be considered as "Italian" speakers.

Editing connections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Editing connections between nodes functions in a manner similar to editing connections on your homepage. The only distinction lies in the fact that a content manager has the ability to edit relations on any page.
