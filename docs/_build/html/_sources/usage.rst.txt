Another method for adding links is through node homepages. Let's say you're exploring the listed expertise areas in KuKaKo and come across one titled "Gothic Architecture," which coincidentally aligns with one of your expertise areas. When you double-click on "Gothic Architecture," it will take you to the homepage of that expertise. Now, if your system is configured to allow you to create links to expertise areas, you'll notice a button on the right-hand side. By clicking on it, you can establish a link to that particular node.
