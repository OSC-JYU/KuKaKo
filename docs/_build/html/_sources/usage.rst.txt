User Documentation
==================

When you enter to KuKaKo, you'll land on your homepage. This is the page where you can see your graph and connect yourself to things that are somehow related to your. Things like what tools you use, what activities you participate, hobbies, cats etc.

Editing homepage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two edit buttons on the right side. The upper (the pencil icon) is for text content like your name and description. The lower one is for links, that you can edit.

Editing textual info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click the "pencil" icon on your homepage. That makes all text fields editable (more pencil icons). When you are ready, just click "save". Click "ready" in order to exit editing mode.

Changing you name works a little bit differently. There is no save button. Instead, just hit enter when you are done with changing your name.


Connecting yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default you'll see only created connections (relations) in your homepage. If you want to edit connections, then find the "links" icon next to "relations".

When you click the icon you'll see all possible connections that you can make.

Editing links by search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another method for adding connections is to connect from other way round. For example, if you get a search hit something interesting like expertise called "Gothic Architecture,

And which coincidentally aligns with one of your expertise areas.

Then, when you are in the the homepage of "Gothic Architecture" and KuKaKo is configured to allow you to create links to expertise areas in its schema, you'll notice a button on the right-hand side. By clicking on it, you can establish a link to that particular node.
