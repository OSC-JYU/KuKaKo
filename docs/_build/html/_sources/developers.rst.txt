Install
=======

KuKaKo is a server-side application accessed through a web browser, which means it operates online and doesn't require users to install it on their desktop computers.

Below is a Quick Start for testing purposes. Developers can find more detailed installation instructions at [https://github.com/OSC-JYU/KuKaKo.git].



Quick Start
------------

This will install KuKaKo in local mode, so that you can test things. You should have Git and Docker Compose installed.


.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/OSC-JYU/KuKaKo.git
    cd KuKaKo
    docker-compose up


Now you should have KuKaKo running on http://localhost:8100
